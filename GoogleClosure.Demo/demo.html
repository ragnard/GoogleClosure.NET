  <!-- 
    We always need to reference base.js first. It provides the basic
    functionality such as depdency management and namespaces. It also
    loads the dependency file for the whole closure-library (goog/deps.js). 
  -->
  <script src="Scripts/closure-library/closure/goog/base.js"></script>
  
  <!--
    We then reference the dependency file for the demo app. This file
    is created by the 'CreateDemoDependencyFile' task in GoogleClosure.targets
    every time the project is built.
  -->
  <script src="Scripts/demo/deps.js"></script>

  <!-- 
    We can now call goog.require to load any namespace or class that we have
    made Google Closure aware about using dependency files (or manual calls to
    goog.addDependency).
    
    In this case, we require the 'demo' namespace, so we can call the 
    demo.initialize() function to boostrap our application.

    goog.require('demo');
