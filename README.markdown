# GoogleClosure tools for .NET

The main goal of this project is to make it simple(r) to use Google Closure 
(library and compiler) in a .NET environment.

## Status

Currently, this project contains a C# implementation of two Google Closure 
tools, `depswriter.py` and `closurebuilder.py`, and their dependencies.

This removes the dependency on Python in a .NET environment.

These tools are currently exposed as two MSBuild tasks.

## Examples

Have a look at example MSBuild files in the `GoogleClosure/examples/` directory.

## Todo
* IHttpHandler for automatically generating `deps` files.
* Maybe tidy up some quick and dirty things
